I‚Äôm with @FettermanLt to ask the PA legislature to get an adult-use marijuana bill to my desk so I can sign it into law. Most Pennsylvanians want to see marijuana legalized in our state, and the profits from this would help small businesses that are struggling due to #COVID19.

Because #COVID19 is so contagious, it takes all of us to stop the spread. This virus spreads through the air, and it only takes one person to create community-wide infection. Please avoid crowds and keep your distance, wear masks in public, and practice good health habits. 

C.947 I.7916 P.D S.Pennsylvania U.@GovernorTomWolf 2020-10-19 15:00:01+00:00
#COVID19 case counts are on the rise here in Pennsylvania. One of the most important things you can do to keep cases from rising even higher is to wear a mask when you are out in public. Masks are required because they work. 

C.948 I.7618 P.D S.Oregon U.@OregonGovBrown 2020-11-13 22:31:45+00:00

LOOK: The rate by which #COVID19 spread across NJ through each infected person. When I issued my stay-at-home order on March 21st, each infected person was spreading COVID-19 to an average of more than 5 other New Jerseyans. Today, that rate of spread is less than one-to-one.

Fewer infections do not mean less risk. Progress in our fight against COVID-19 does not mean the battle is done. As we've seen so many times, 1 infection becomes 100 very rapidly. We can limit opportunities for COVID-19 to spread, &amp; we have, but we can't eliminate them entirely.

The Ronald McDonald House in NYC ran out of hand sanitizer &amp; couldn't get more. I'm glad NYS could help by delivering some "NYS Clean." It's easy to forget that containing a virus isn‚Äôt just about making sure you don‚Äôt get sick‚Äîit‚Äôs making sure NY's most vulnerable are protected

I never want to get to a place where our families or friends don‚Äôt have a place to heal, or where our hospitals don‚Äôt have the capacity to give them the best chance possible to beat COVID-19. That's why we've stood up five Alternate Care Facilities across Illinois.

Wearing a face covering is not about politics. It‚Äôs about being sick or healthy. It's about life and death. It's about showing others that you care about their health. It's about showing your community what side you‚Äôre on in the fight against #COVID19.

From the beginning, Trump knew how deadly coronavirus was‚Äîbut he lied to the American people about the threat it posed. As a result, America now has more than 7 million cases. Over 204,000 people have died. We need a president who will take this virus seriously‚Äîthat‚Äôs @JoeBiden.

C.6117 I.7877 P.D S.Oregon U.@OregonGovBrown 2020-02-12 05:22:13+00:00
Antarctica is one of the fastest warming places on Earth, and many of its glaciers are melting due to global warming. Stop and think: when temps in one of the coldest places are nearly the same as those in Southern California, doesn't that mean something? 

C.6118 I.3372 P.D S.Kentucky U.@GovAndyBeshear 2020-03-22 14:33:19+00:00
These Sunday mornings at home are tough on many of us, but as a man of faith I know we are doing the right thing. Thank you for the sacrifices you are making to keep #TeamKentucky safe from #COVID19. #TogetherKy 

C.6119 I.3887 P.D S.Michigan U.@GovWhitmer 2020-08-05 21:31:08+00:00
Today, I declared racism to be a public health crisis in Michigan and created the Black Leadership Advisory Council. #COVID19 has highlighted what Black &amp; Brown communities have always known ‚Äî inequities caused by systemic racism can be deadly. We‚Äôre confronting this head on. 

C.6120 I.6775 P.D S.New York U.@NYGovCuomo 2020-08-07 15:44:44+00:00
Every region is well below our COVID infection limit, therefore all school districts are authorized to open. If the infection rate spikes, the guidance will change accordingly. School districts are required to submit plans to NYS for review. 

C.6121 I.9117 P.D S.Guam U.@louleonguerrero 2020-05-23 06:33:52+00:00

When nearly 4 out of 10 American households are still uncounted, a surprise decision to cut the Census count short in the middle of a pandemic is unpatriotic, illogical and immoral. 

C.6124 I.7652 P.D S.Oregon U.@OregonGovBrown 2020-10-18 17:35:03+00:00
It's Sunday ‚Äì a great time to get your flu shot! The seasonal flu is most dangerous for older folks and young kids. By getting your flu shot, you protect yourself, and you also protect the vulnerable people in your community who aren't able to get the vaccine. 

C.6125 I.9679 P.D S.P2020 U.@JoeBiden 2020-08-28 23:00:00+00:00
The President incites violence, inspires white-supremacist shooters, and his failed COVID response is costing thousands of lives per day. When you look at the world right now, ask yourself: Do you feel safe in Trump‚Äôs America?

C.6132 I.9730 P.D S.P2020 U.@JoeBiden 2020-07-17 00:15:00+00:00
President Obama and I left a playbook for President Trump on how to fight pandemics. He flat-out ignored it. And we're all paying the price every day.

C.6144 I.9368 P.D S.VP2020 U.@KamalaHarris 2020-07-08 00:58:00+00:00
We are months into a global pandemic that has left millions unemployed and people scraping together to pay their rent. We can't leave people behind during this crisis. That's why I introduced a bill with @BernieSanders and @EdMarkey to give people $2,000 monthly payments. 

C.6145 I.2166 P.D S.Illinois U.@GovPritzker 2020-09-04 00:46:49+00:00
As we mourn those we‚Äôve lost to COVID-19, let‚Äôs also allow this pandemic to remind us of at least one important thing ‚Äì we need each other. The measure of this moment in our history will be tallied in how well we cared for each other. 

C.6146 I.9347 P.D S.VP2020 U.@KamalaHarris 2020-07-25 01:46:00+00:00
Yesterday the U.S. surpassed 4M coronavirus cases. There's still no adequate national testing strategy. There's still no adequate national contact tracing strategy. There's still no adequate national PPE strategy. Trump can‚Äôt absolve himself of responsibility‚Äîthis is on him.

C.6151 I.7772 P.D S.Oregon U.@OregonGovBrown 2020-06-19 22:15:50+00:00
Take it from @OregonSOS Bev Clarno: Vote-by-mail is safe, secure, and healthy. While COVID-19 disrupted in-person elections around the country, Oregon had record turnout for the May primary, and no one had to risk their health to cast their ballot. 

C.6152 I.4916 P.D S.New Jersey U.@GovMurphy 2020-07-20 16:17:13+00:00
We remember Martin Addison, who came to the U.S. at the age of 8. Martin was only 44 years old. He was a speech-language pathologist, but his favorite job was as ‚ÄúPapa‚Äù to his 2-year-old daughter and 5-month-old son. A life that #COVID19 took way too soon. We pray for Martin.

A slight change of tone from the president for one night doesn‚Äôt cover up the lies he told. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that over 220,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on his watch. We can‚Äôt take another four years of Donald Trump‚Äôs failed leadership.

Last week, I vetoed House Bill 2513 because it would have endangered public health and safety by allowing restaurants to open up to full capacity without regard for state and federal COVID-19 mitigation guidelines. Tonight House Republicans tried to override that veto. 

C.6577 I.5287 P.D S.New Jersey U.@GovMurphy 2020-06-01 18:57:43+00:00

Don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the Trump Administration is in court trying to eliminate Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's heartless. I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need. 

C.6581 I.9041 P.D S.Guam U.@louleonguerrero 2020-10-03 12:25:59+00:00
82 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed today, and we sadly announced our 51st COVID-19 fatality. It doesn't get any easier announcing these passings ‚Äîand it shouldn't. These are our people, and for many, they died alone without the comfort of family beside them. 

C.6582 I.7911 P.D S.Pennsylvania U.@GovernorTomWolf 2020-10-21 16:00:01+00:00

Donald Trump will do everything he can to distract from the fact that because of his failed COVID-19 response: - Over 200,000 Americans have died - 26 million are on unemployment - 1 in 6 small businesses risk permanent closure We can‚Äôt let him.

To effectively stop the spread of COVID-19, the people who call to say you may have been exposed to the virus should speak the same languages as who they're calling. Culturally-responsive health programs are a commonsense way to bring racial equity to our COVID-19 response.

Wearing a mask is not about politics. Wearing a mask doesn‚Äôt show weakness. Wearing a mask is about caring for your community, your family, your friends, your loved ones, and your neighbors. Every time you put your mask on, you show leadership against this virus.

Coronavirus has killed nearly 130,000 Americans. We were warned the U.S. could see 100,000 new cases a day. Yet there is still no adequate national testing strategy. It could not be more clear: Trump has surrendered to this virus and abandoned Americans.

The government is doing what we can, but we need your help too. Based on simulations, extensive (and even moderate) social distancing outperforms attempted forced quarantine methods. If we can minimize the amount of contact we have, the virus has less opportunity to spread.
