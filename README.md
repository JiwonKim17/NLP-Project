Exploration of COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter: American Politician Edition (Final Project NLP Paper.pdf)

This research aims to investigate COVID-19 discourse on Twitter, specifically that of tweets
made by the US politicians. This is further evaluated through the lens of Twitter data from Republican
and Democratic political leaders. Through this exploration, we aim to develop an understanding of the
terminology used in association to COVID-19 by each political party, most frequent topics addressed, as
well as sentiment (left-leaning or right-leaning) of tweets posted. A corpora, created from 12 months of
Twitter data, will illuminate the language used by individuals over the course of the pandemic and the
differences associated with political parties from this data. Analysis of terminology on the corpora is done
using the bag-of-words model, bigram analysis, and TF-IDF. Sentiment analysis, to determine left or right
leaning score is done with LinearSVC. The project contributes to current research by providing analysis
on language used during the COVID-19 pandemic specific to the US Republican and Democratic
politicians, as well as provides insight to ways in which left or right leaning tweets can be predicted based
on this new set of terminology.
